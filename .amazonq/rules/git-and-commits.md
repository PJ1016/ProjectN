# Git and Commit Guidelines

## Commit Messages
- Use conventional commit format: type(scope): description
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Include body for complex changes explaining why, not what

## Branch Naming
- Use descriptive branch names: feature/user-authentication
- Prefixes: feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/, chore/
- Use kebab-case for branch names
- Keep branch names concise but descriptive

## Code Review
- Review for logic, not just syntax
- Check for potential security issues
- Ensure tests are included for new features
- Verify accessibility compliance
- Check for performance implications

## Pull Requests
- Write clear PR descriptions
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Link related issues
- Ensure CI/CD passes before requesting review
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized

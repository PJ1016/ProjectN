# Best Practices

## Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add comments only when business logic is complex
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Avoid magic numbers - use named constants

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries for React components
- Handle async operations with try-catch blocks
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Implement fallback UI for error states

## Performance
- Lazy load components and routes when appropriate
- Optimize images and assets
- Use React DevTools to identify performance bottlenecks
- Implement proper memoization strategies
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain proper color contrast ratios
- Add alt text for images

## Security
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Avoid exposing sensitive data in client-side code
- Validate data on both client and server sides

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test component behavior, not implementation details
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Maintain good test coverage for critical paths
